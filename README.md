# WeRTC - A Fully P2P, Single-File WebRTC Chat

Just for Fun - Pushing the Limits of a Single HTML File!

WeRTC is a self-contained, browser-based P2P chat application built entirely in a single HTML file.
It works locally or over the internet, requires no servers, and runs entirely on WebRTC.

## Features

- **No Servers Required** - Pure P2P communication.
- **Minimal Dependencies** - Only uses a public STUN server, WebRTC and external JS libraries.
- **Self-Contained, Single HTML File** - Just download and open in your browser.
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on all modern browsers that support WebRTC.
- **Decentralized** - No central authority or server. All communication is directly between peers.

- **No NAT Traversal for Hard Firewalls** - Requires a public IP or port forwarding for direct connections.

## Why WeRTC Exists

* Just for Fun - To see how much functionality can be packed into a single HTML file.
* Experimentation - To learn more about WebRTC and P2P communication.
* Test the Limits - To see how far we can push the boundaries of a single-file application.
* Decentralization - To explore the possibilities of fully decentralized, serverless applications.
